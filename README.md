# Botanic Mixed Set

A Simplified Plant Image Segmentation Dataset for Effective Benchmarking.

## Overview

This repository contains a Plant Image Segmentation Dataset, "Botanic Mixed Set" designed for use in computer vision and image segmentation tasks. The dataset consists of 47 plant images along with corresponding masks for pixel-level segmentation.

**Note:** Only 7 sample images are available directly on GitHub due to space constraints. If you need access to the entire dataset, please contact via email.

## Dataset Structure

- `Image/`: This directory contains 7 sample plant images in PNG format.

- `Mask/`: Corresponding masks for the sample images in PNG format.

## Sample Images

![Sample Image 1](Image/Image_2.png) | ![Sample Image 2](Image/Image_3.png) | ![Sample Image 3](Image/Image_5.png)
--- | --- | ---
*Sample Image 1* | *Sample Image 2* | *Sample Image 3*

## Sample Masks

![Sample Image 1](Mask/Image_2_mask.png) | ![Sample Image 2](Mask/Image_3_mask.png) | ![Sample Image 3](Mask/Image_5_mask.png)
--- | --- | ---
*Sample Mask 1* | *Sample Mask 2* | *Sample Mask 3*

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/mukund-ks/botanic-mixed-set.git
